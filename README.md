## Overview
This repository contains the codebase and documentation for the "Classification Model to Identify Multiple Diseases" project conducted under the YBI FOUNDATION internship program. The project focuses on leveraging data analytics techniques to develop a robust classification model capable of identifying multiple diseases.

## Project Description
# Objective
The primary goal of this project is to design and implement a classification model that can accurately identify and classify multiple diseases based on relevant data. The model aims to contribute to advancements in healthcare by providing a tool for early disease detection and diagnosis.
